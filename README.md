### Instructions

Creating a website by using the visualizations that were created in the Python-APIs Challenge, called ["WeatherPy"](https://github.com/Kaludii/python-api-challenge/tree/main/WeatherPy).

#### Website Requirements

The overall requirements for the website was as follows:

* The website must consist of seven pages.

* At the top of every page, the website must have a navigation bar.

* The website must be deployed to GitHub Pages.

The website must also consist of seven pages as follows:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) that contains the following elements:

  * An explanation of the project.

  * A link to each visualization page. For these, a sidebar should contain a preview image of each visualization. Clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), stored in the `visualizations` folder, each with the following elements:

  * A descriptive title and a heading tag.

  * The visualization for the selected comparison (latitude vs. max temperature, latitude vs. humidity, latitude vs. cloudiness, or latitude vs. wind speed). The images that these pages display should be stored in the `assets/images` folder.

  * A paragraph describing the visualization and its significance.

* A [comparisons page](#comparisons-page) that does the following:

  * Contains all the visualizations on the same page so that people can easily compare them.

  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations. This grid must contain two visualizations across a medium or large screen and one visualization across an extra-small or small screen.

* A [data page](#data-page) that displays a responsive table containing the data that the visualizations use, as follows:

  * The table must be a Bootstrap `table` component.

  * The data must come from either exporting or converting the CSV file to HTML.

At the top of every page, the website must have a navigation bar that does the following:

* Contains the name of the site on the left side of the navigation bar, allowing users to return to the landing page from any page.

* Contains a drop-down menu, named Plots, on the right side of the navigation bar that contains a link to each visualization page.

* Provides two more text links on the right side: Comparisons, which links to the comparisons page, and Data, which links to the data page.

* Is responsive (via media queries).

#### Screenshots

This section contains screenshots of each page, at various screen widths, that you must create. Keep in mind that these screenshots are intended as a guide. You can meet the requirements without exactly matching your pages to the screenshots.
